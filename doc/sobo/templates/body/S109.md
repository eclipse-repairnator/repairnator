This has an easy fix, but it is important to understand why it is a bad practice.

**Magic numbers** are numbers that are used in your code without any explanation. This can lead to confusion and bugs. Here is an example:


⛔️ **Instead of doing this:**
```java
public class Example{

    /* Foo method */
    public static void foo() {
        // '4' is a magic number 😱🪄
        for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++){            
            ...
        }
    }   
}
```

✅ **Do this:**
```java
public class Example {
    // in java, constants are written in UPPER_CASE
    public static final int NUMBER_OF_CYCLES = 4; 

    /* Foo method */
    public static void foo() {
        // ah, it's the number of cycles!
        for(int i = 0; i < NUMBER_OF_CYCLES ; i++){
            ...

        }
```

❓  Curious fact : -1, 0 and 1 are not considered magic numbers 😱
