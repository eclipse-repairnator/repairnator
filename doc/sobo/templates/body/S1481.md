🤖 : _My primary mission here is to help you to improve your code quality..._

🤖 : _I know that making your code compile might represent enough challenge for you already, but making small changes can boost your work!_


An example of what to do:

⛔️ **Instead of doing this:**

```java
  /**
   * Count the number of sheep in a list
   * */
    public static int countSheep(List<Sheep> sheeps){
        int wolves=0;       // unused variable!
        String = "Zzz...";  // unused variable!
        int numberOfSheep=0;
        for(Sheep s : sheeps) { // is 's' unused? 🤔
            numberOfSheep++;
        }
        return numberOfSheep;
    }
```

✅ **Do this:**
```java
  /**
   * Count the number of sheep in a list
   * */
    public static int countSheep(List<Sheep> sheeps){
        int numberOfSheep=0;  
        for(int i = 0; i < sheeps.size(); i++) {
            numberOfSheep++;
        }
        return numberOfSheep;
    }
```

  <summary> 📚 Why maintainability matters  </summary>

When learning programming, you often write code without a second thought on how *maintainable* the code is. You might already have experienced the dread of coming back to a code you wrote a few days ago and not being able to understand what you were thinking. A maintainable code is easy to understand and to change. It includes making comments, using decent variable names, and following good design practices. 

In software development, time and resources are precious. If you focus on making your software maintainable, other developers may understand your code easily. In short; maintainability leads to happy and efficent colleagues!

If you are interested in learning more about maintainability, you can read this [article](https://www.baeldung.com/java-clean-code) on clean code.

🤖 : _This might seem obvious, but simple changes can make huge impact in your code readability_

🤖 : _Good quality code starts one step at a time_

🤖 : _Always try to keep your code clean, and after making changes , make sure that you don´t have any unuse variables. One small step for you, but also a giant leap for your coming CS career._


 ❓  Curious fact: In 2020, CISQ estimated the [cost of poor software quality in the US](https://www.it-cisq.org/cisq-files/pdf/CPSQ-2020-report.pdf) to be **$2.08 trillion**. That's roughly to 10% of the United States gross domestic product 😱
