In the programming world, we developers are a civilized squad. For different programming languages or situations, we define protocols or conventions. One Java Code Convention is the members of a class or interface declaration should appear in the following order in the source files:
- Class variables
- Instance variables
- Constructors
- Methods

An example of what to do:

⛔️ **Instead of doing this:**
```java
public class Indamon{
   private int hp= 0;
   
   public boolean isFainted() {...}
   
   public Indamon() {...}                         // Constructor defined after methods
   
   public static final int LEGS= 4;  //Variable defined after constructors and methods
}

```

✅ **Do this:**
```java
public class Indamon{
   //fields
   public static final int LEGS= 4;  
   private int hp= 0;
   //constructors
   public Indamon() {...}
   //methods
   public boolean isFainted() {...}
}

```

❓  Curious fact : Other conventions are for the name of JAVA classes. For example, [all class names should be in CamelCase format](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-naming-conventions#:~:text=CamelCase%20in%20Java%20naming%20conventions,%2C%20ActionEvent%2C%20ActionListener%2C%20etc.), developers should use whole words, and they must avoid acronyms and abbreviations. 😱
