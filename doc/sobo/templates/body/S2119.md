When you use random numbers in Java, you call the Random library. In this case, you probably want to create an object, and this, in terms of code, looks like this: 

`Random rand = new Random();`

And to get a random Integer number, you probably do the following:

`int rValue = rand.nextInt();`

The problem is that you shouldn't create a new Random object when you want to generate another random value. Instead, it would be best if you reused the first object. Here is an example:

⛔️ **Instead of doing this:**
```java
public class Example{
    public int getRandomInt(){
        Random rand = new Random();
        return rand.nextInt();
    }
}
```

✅ **Do this:**
```java
public class Example{
    Random rand = new Random();

    public int getRandomInt(){
        return this.rand.nextInt();
    }
}
```

And don't worry about breaking the randomness by doing this. The original Random object creates a new random Integer on every call to the function `nextInt()`.
